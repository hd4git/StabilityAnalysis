# StabilityAnalysis

To identify factors associated with stable or unstable transgene expression, genomic and transcriptomic profiles were observed around the transgene integration sites as reported by Cergentis using the TLA-Seq data.

**Genome (WGS):**
  1. Small variants - single nucleotide variations and small INDELs
  2. Structural variations - Large insertions, deletions, inversions, duplications and translocations
  3. Low and high variability regions
  
**Transcriptome (RNA-Seq):**
  1. Differential expression
  2. Low and high expression peaks
  
For investigating association of genomic rearrangements at integration level with expression stability, **TLA-Seq** data was analyzed at early as well as late passage for the producer cell lines.
